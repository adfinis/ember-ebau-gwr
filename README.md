# ember-ebau-gwr

Ember Engine for the [inosca/ebau-gwr](https://github.com/inosca/ebau-gwr) backend.

## Development

```
# start a local CORS proxy
yarn proxy
# start dev server
yarn start
```

## Compatibility

- Ember.js v3.28 or above
- Ember CLI v3.28 or above
- Node.js v14 or above

## Installation

```
ember install ember-ebau-gwr
```

## Usage

Mount the engine in your router file. You can specify a param in the url which
will then be used to filter the `gwr-links` by their attribute `local_id`.

```js
this.mount("ember-ebau-gwr", { as: "gwr", path: "gwr/:id" });
```

### Enviroment configuration
In your `config/environment.js` you need to define the following option for
`changeset-validations`. We use this feature to generate translated errors:
```js
"changeset-validations": { rawOutput: true },
```

> **Important**
> This currentlry has the limitation, that if your app uses
`changeset-validations` itself, this option changes the behaviour in the whole
app. Due to engine config restrictions, there is sadly currently no other way
than maybe implementing something on build-pipeline level.

### Styling

The engine uses the UI framework "UIkit" through [ember-uikit](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/ember-uikit). To enable the styling, add the following import to `app/styles/app.scss`:

```scss
@import "ember-uikit";
@import "ember-ebau-gwr";
```

### Services

The engine takes following services as argument:

```js
dependencies = {
  services: [
    "config",
    "intl",
    "notification",
    "dataImport",
    "store",
    "session",
  ],
};
```

#### `config`

The config service is used to pass config to the engine. The following properties can be configured:

| Name                 | Type             | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gwrAPI`             | `URL Path`       | URL path to the gwr api proxy. Example: `/housing-stat/regbl/api/ech0216/`                         |
| `isTestEnvironment`  | `Boolean`        | Is the code deployed on staging or production                                                      |
| `cantonAbbreviation` | `String`         | `BE`, `SZ`,`UR` etc.                                                                               |
| `importModels`       | `[String]`       | A list of model names for which the import should be available. Example: `["project", "building"]` |
| `authToken`          | `String`         | The authentication toke from the host app.                                                         |
| `camacGroup`         | `String\|Number` | The current camac group of the user.                                                               |
| `pageSize`           | `Number`         | The page size which the gwr api should return.                                                     |
| `modalContainer`     | `CSS Selector`   | A CSS selector to render the modals in.                                                           |

All values should follow the officially used format.

#### `dataImport`

In the `dataImport` service the consuming application fetches and formats the data into the expected format. The format is the same data structure as the model properties which can be found in `/addon/models`.

The service should define a `fetchProject: async () -> Promise<Object>` function.

#### `session`

We expect a `ember-simple-auth` session service which has the
`data.authenticated.access_token` set.
